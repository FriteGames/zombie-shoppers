### Roadmap

infinite levels, where each level gets progressively harder

* more zombies
* faster zombies
* harder to kill zombies
* more complex missions

takes place at big box retailers, during seasonal sales and promotions

the following levels repeat indefinitely, year after year.
difficulty ramps up for each level, and increases by a scalar value for each new year.

* super bowl -> get a tv at best buy
* president's day weekend -> get a new car
* memorial day
* independence day
* labor day
* new iphone
* black friday

consumerism never stops, and gets more and more ridiculous each year.
4K, 8k, 16K tvs
iphone 10, 11, 12, 13
etc

player can only shoot if they are not carrying an item
player really should forget the item and just leave.

zombies are only after the item.
zombies damage the player if they come into contact,
player needs to get the item before the zombies get it
get it back to the car
kill as many zombies as they can for funsies, to lessen likelihood of damage + having item stolen.

player has 3 lives.
